After making changes,
```
git add -A
git commit -m "Write sample commit message in imperative mood (ie not 'Wrote sample...')"
git push
```

## To view
Within the specific project folder, simply double click on
``` 
index.html
```
to open it in your favorite browser (which we all know should be chrome...)
